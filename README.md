# EveryContact

EveryContact is a web app for managing and viewing your contacts. It uses a separate backend API (deployed on Vercel) for user data and contacts.

## Usage

- **Use Online:** Access the fully working version here: [EveryContact](https://<your-vercel-deployment-url>)
- **Run Locally:**  
  1. Clone the repo: `git clone git@github.com:maksymsyr/everycontact.git`  
  2. Install dependencies: `npm install`  
  3. Start the app: `npm start`  
  4. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser  

No local database setup is needed; the frontend connects to the deployed backend automatically.
